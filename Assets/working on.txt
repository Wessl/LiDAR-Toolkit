refactor so that not all fields in lidar.cs are public??+
maybe normals could be used in some fun way. 
check what has to be done in order to publish someting on the unity asset store, like how do we package, how do we hide our precious source code, any legal/payment setup, etc...
more optimization!!! 
 should we have some kind of api where a game user can change settings? of course the person using this asset is gonna set it up, 
 but what if they want to allow the gamer to change it dynamically in game? think about it .
 recreate or remove any third party stuff (e.g. the hair dryer)
 need locally provided documentation
 "2.5.a Scripts include namespaces within which all named entities and identifiers are declared. You can find more information about namespaces in Microsoft's C# documentation." wtf is the meaning
 "4.1.b Publishers have an active email address and an actively maintained website that shows relevant work and skill sets." is a github page enough? 
 
learn more about gpu stuff so we can optimize that stuff too
more advanced range-based with like a variety of colors not just lerping between two. also, normals. 
dude what if we did one that could BOUNCE! we could do a ray-tracing lite??? that would be fucking INSANE? 
the puck scanner is a little buggy? not sure what to do with it. 
spread out the super scan lines line renderer thing
circles zwrite: if on, and also using fade out: "invisible" points cover up visible points due to them still writing to zbuffer even though they are alpha = 0. 
pixels, but BIG. basically you could just do circle but square and then make size independent of distance to camera. its possible. its just math. do it.
cpu utilization across cores is not as high as I would have expected - are we really all that parallel? 
oh yeah and idk make the lines that are drawn to the point look better. line renderer was a fun little debug thing, but we can do better? maybe? or not. idk
should points that go off into space and never create a poiint, count as a point having been created?
le bug: if you set Hard vram limit too high it wraps around and becomes negative. also if you just set it to higher than it is now you start breaking stuff with out of range exceptions and stuff, bad! 

some kind of startup message on first play that says "hey this is how the thing works. we have 3 point types, use the correct shaders. these pipelines are supported". 

HDRP    - Will probably not do since we need to rewrite some shader stuff, sounds like a pain. also why do you need hdrp in a point cloud game xd
